# üé¨ Movie Explorer

**Movie Explorer** is an iOS application built using Swift and UIKit that allows users to browse, explore, and manage their favorite movies using [The Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). The app is built with clean architecture principles and focuses on providing a responsive, modular, and offline-friendly movie browsing experience.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift 5.9
- **UI Framework**: UIKit with Auto Layout (Both Programmatic and Storyboard)
- **Networking**: URLSession
- **Local Persistence**: Core Data
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) 
- **Package Management**: Swift Package Manager

---

## üß± Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM**, ensuring:
- Clear separation of concerns (UI, Business Logic, Networking, Data).
- Modular, testable, and reusable components.
- Clean folder and file organization.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements Fulfilled

- [x] Home Screen with movie listing and pull-to-refresh.
- [x] Movie Detail Screen with rich movie data and favourite marking.
- [x] Favourites Screen with locally persisted movies.
- [x] URLSession integration with proper error handling.
- [x] Codable for parsing API responses.
- [x] Core Data for offline caching and favourite movie storage.
- [x] Modular MVVM Swift codebase.

## üåü Bonus Features

- [ ] Redirection Link to the Movie's official webpage on Safari
- [ ] Dependency Injection ( using Repository design pattern)
- [ ] Reusable UI components
- [ ] Memory management best practices
- [ ] Illustrated Some Unit Tests

## üåê APIs Used

- [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3):
  - Fetching movie lists, details, and images.
  - Used endpoints:
    - `/trending/movie/`
    - `/movie/{movie_id}`

- [TMDb Image Base URL](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/image-basics)
  - Images served via: `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500{poster_path}`
  - Supports dynamic sizing (e.g. `w200`, `w500`, etc.)

---
## ‚öñÔ∏è Tradeoffs & Assumptions

- **Poster image uses `.scaleToFill` contentMode**: Chosen for layout simplicity, though it may distort images on extreme aspect ratios.
- **Core Data for local persistence**: Lightweight and native, but less flexible than alternatives like SQLite for more complex queries.
- For smaller views classes used same class for everything rather than strict MVVM for simplicity.
